- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hargwit
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Javascript, React, NodeJS and Java to name a few!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about throw-away environments to improve devops processes, using a mix of Kubernetes, Kind and Skaffold. Checkout my [auth-server](https://github.com/hargwit/auth-server) project to see how I am getting along!
